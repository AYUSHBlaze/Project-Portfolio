This is my very first implementation of what I've learnt in Web Development.<br>
[Project-Portfolio is a team project this repository contains what were my contributions in the project.]
What were my contributions in this project?, <br>
1)I coded the feedback form for the main page.<br>
2)I made a portfolio of my own.
However, If you wish to see the whole project here's the link: https://github.com/darkzy6969<br>
The main file is named Portfolio.html
