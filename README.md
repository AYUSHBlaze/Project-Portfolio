This is my very first implementation of what I've learnt in Web Development.<br>
[Project-Portfolio is a team project this repository contains what were my contributions in the project.]<br>
What were my contributions in this project?, <br>
**1)I coded the feedback form for the main page.**<br>
**2)I made a portfolio of my own.**<br>
**3)Also, I made my portfolio responsive.**<br>
*i.e. The page dynamically changes it's appearance depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. (That's a whole lot of explanation :)).*<br>
However, If you wish to see the whole project here's the link: https://github.com/darkzy6969<br>
The main file is named Portfolio.html
